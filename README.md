#This project is a web form that collects data about BAIS students at the University of Iowa. It is meant to help teach HTML and CSS and collect data relevant to the department.


#How your web form conforms to best practices for forms
#I split the form into multiple pages so that the user isn't overwhelmed when using the form. 
#I also made it so it would adapt to the platform you are using the form on such as mobile or pc. 
#In addition I also clearly layout what the Form is about in the intro, then get into data collection, and then lastly a thankyou, all pages are easily navigable from the provided buttons
#Drop down boxes, radio, and check boxes are also utilized to make it easier on the user.
#The flow and layout of the form is makes it easy to understand and use
#I only collect necessary data
#I have a progress indicator, saying which page they are on

#How your form provides for user accessibility:
#easy to read fonts, and sizes.
#correct contrasts between background and text so it's easy to see
#My form works with screen readers so the visually impaired can use it
#tooltips are used to help clarify why it is being collected or what it means
#required and non required fields are indicated
